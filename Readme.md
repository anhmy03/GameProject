# Express Routes

The Basic REST API using Node + Express JS.

## Installation
- Get the project
    - clone

            `git clone https://github.com/anhmy03/GameProject`
    - download zip.
- Open the project in VSCode.
- Open a Terminal.
- Install required packages.
    - `npm install`
- Start the server
    - `nodemon server.js`

## API Endpoints
Use ThunderClient to try the following endpoints:

http://localhost:3000/games/all
http://localhost:3000/games/1
http://localhost:3000/cart/user/1
http://localhost:3000/cart/checkout/user/1

These are endpoints that will appear with frontend too. Because I already do some of those with front end included,
so we have to run it with frontend
